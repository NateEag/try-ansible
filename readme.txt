I care a good bit about automating infrastructure.

I would also like to make my hosting provider ephemeral.

I started working towards that goal with Puppet, but after attending a talk at
CPOSC 2014, I decided to look into Ansible.

I liked what I saw at first. I can see how Puppet is probably better for many
cases, but for what I want to do, Ansible might be best, and it seems like it
might fit my personal style well.

So, I'd like to try setting up some basic server provisioning via Ansible on a
Vagrant box and see how it goes.
